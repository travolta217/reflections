it helped me to see typos easier the comparing the files manually

I don't have to worry about old verisons of my code and i can concentrate on writing code. 

pros: better orginized and understandable commit log. Easier to roll back a particular logical change without affecting other changes.
cons: possibilty of forgetting to commit. Commits could be too big which could lead to a merge conflict

those files have a logical connection

withngit log i see the commit history and with git diff i can compare the commits ads see changes made

one can easily roll back changes
