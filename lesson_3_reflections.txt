When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when there is other contributors or when i work in more then one place or just to save my work on a safer place.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
pulling automatically would cause merge conflicts all the time when i work on same files which were changed by others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are repos on GitHub. Clones are copies of other repos on your computer. Branches are used for versioning or implementing of a feature in your clone.
