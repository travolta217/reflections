git creates .git to track the files in the directory. I need it for versioning

staging area insures an additional level of repository. Without it one must commit all changes to the repository

i can add files seperately to the staging area

i could make new versions of my programm using new branches and keep old ones untouched

they show every branch as a line of commits(stars)

the result is one single branch

automatic merges saves time for obvious merges. Complicated ones can be done manually
